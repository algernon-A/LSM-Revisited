# Loading Screen Mod Revisited.
A Cities: Skylines mod, developed from original code by Thale5.

Customizes the loading screen, offers a number of options to control loading (and what is and isn't loaded), and (most importantly) significantly improves the performance, and reduces the memory footprint, of the game when loading custom assets.

For more detail, and for Steam binaries, see the mod's [Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858591409).

Binaries for the Epic Games version of Cities: Skylines are available via the Discord linked on the Steam Workshop page.
